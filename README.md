# TaskList

## What for?
Hmm... One day mom wanted to buy a board where she could write her notes so as not to remember all the time what she needed. And then one day I'm like this, and let me do this thing and that's it... Mom said okay. I came home and did. :D

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bobiclaki/TaskList
cd TaskList
npm i -tls
node .
```
